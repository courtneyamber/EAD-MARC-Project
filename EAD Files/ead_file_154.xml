                                 <p>This collection contains copies of papers and records pertaining to the community at New Harmony, Indiana.</p>
                                 <p>The town of New Harmony was established in 1814 by a group of German Separatists. Ten years later, the settlement of New Harmony and the surrounding land was purchased by Robert Owen. Owen hoped to create a utopian community based on education, social reform, and communal living. The community established a government in the form of the Preliminary Society in May 1825, and the town adopted a constitution in February 1826. Due to complications from inequality of credits given to purchase goods, overcrowding, lack of self-sufficient production of goods, and the promotion of enlightenment ideals over religious beliefs by Owen, the utopian community dissolved in 1829.</p>
                                 <p>The Working Men&#039;s Institute was founded in New Harmony in 1838 by William Maclure, who had embraced the importance of education that was promoted by the utopian community. The Institute provided a central location for laborers to come together and learn from each other. The Institute, which is still in existence as of 2017, includes the oldest library in continuous operation, a museum, and an archives.</p>
                                 <p>The collection includes materials grouped into five series labeled A-E. Series A contains copies of letters, clippings, and other documents concerning the formation and activities of New Harmony. Series B includes copies of legal documents pertaining to Robert Owen&#039;s purchase of New Harmony and the litigation following its disintegration. Series C contains copies of proceedings of the Preliminary Society, minutes of the convention established to form a constitution, other accounts of the New Harmony Community, and journals of the Education Society founded in the community by William Maclure in 1826. Series D contains copies of correspondence of New Harmony Community members. Series E includes copies of maps of New Harmony and the surrounding area. Also included in the collection is a copy of a catalog by Arthur Bestor, Jr., which describes the items in the collection that are contained on microfilm.</p>
                                 <p>Arthur E. Bestor, Jr. donated the copies and microfilm to the Illinois Historical Survey, the predecessor of the Illinois History and Lincoln Collections, from 1950-1951. He also directed the photocopying and microfilming of the originals, which are currently in the possession of the New Harmony Working Men&#039;s Institute.</p>
