               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                                 <p>This collection consists of the unpublished manuscript of Jack J. Nortrup&#039;s book on the American Civil War and some of his handwritten research notes.</p>
                                 <p>Jack J. Nortrup (1925-1984) was born in Scott County, Illinois. He earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of Illinois in 1961 and became an associate professor of history at Southeastern Missouri State College and at State University College, Oswego, New York. In the 1970s, he served as chair of the Department of Social Studies and later as dean of the Schools of Arts and Sciences at Tri-State College (now Trine University), in Angola, Indiana. As an historian of Illinois history, Nortrup wrote several articles on Gov. Richard Yates (1861-1865) as well.</p>
                                 <p>The collection includes drafts of the 15 chapters which contain Nortrup&#039;s handwritten edits and annotations. The unpublished manuscript details the political and military history of the American Civil War including social and political relationships between generals and politicians, the frustrations of both the public and the military over the long lasting and politically fraught war, the tension between professional military and volunteer militia, the politics and culture surrounding West Point and its students at the time, and President Lincoln&#039;s relationships with his generals and other politicians.</p>
                                 <p>This collection was donated to the Library by Jack Nortrup&#039;s wife Evelyn in 1998.</p>
