               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                                 <p>This volume was used by an unknown physician in Sadorus, Ill., to record the names of his patients, their maladies, their treatment, and their bills (if they paid). Four pages of &#039;Obstetrics&#039; show how for a few years this unnamed doctor delivered two or three babies each month, recording the mode of delivery, length of labor, sex, condition, and the instances when the child or mother died. There is some evidence of abortions and of the sale of alcohol-as-medicine. Obstetrics (&#039;Ob care&#039; in the ledger) may have provided the most income, usually at $10.00 a visit; a few operations earned the doctor $25.00; while the great majority of entries are for $1.00 or less, to dispense powders, pills, frumentii, castoria, camphor, &#039;Wizard Oil,&#039; gin, iodine, Hire syrup, Pepsin syrup, salve, liniment, peruna, or just &#039;medicine.&#039; Catarrh, teeth, and broken bones are among the most common complaints. The ledger also documents the costs of the doctor&#039;s stock and other expenses in running the practice.</p>
                                 <p>The patients&#039; means of payment included cash, notes, drayage, oats, lumber, labor, etc.  Some bills went unpaid for one to three years, and many are written off as &#039;Bad.&#039; Also noted are some rebates and credits to patients.  The patients came from throughout southwest Champaign County, a few from town, several from &#039;Campbell&#039;s Farm&#039; (probably that of David Campbell, five miles to the south), and a few from out of state.</p>
                                 <p>The doctor also kept the dues and roster of the Sadorus Cornet-Band in 1906.</p>
                                 <p>This ledger was acquired by the Library in 2005.</p>
