               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                                 <p>This collection contains three Lincoln forgeries: a letter of June 1, 1852, and two legal papers dated June 1, 1858. Although all are purportedly written or signed by Abraham Lincoln, they clearly are not in his hand.</p>
                                 <p>The letter is addressed to J. Edwards to whom Lincoln in fact wrote on another matter on the same day.<emph render="super">1</emph> The forgery refers to John A. McClernand as a potential Whig candidate &quot;for a vacancy in Bloomington,&quot; although he was in fact a Douglas Democrat from Shawneetown.</p>
                                 <p>On June 7, 1937, Felix Roppert, writing from the City Hall Station in New York City, offered this letter to the Library for $10. Annotating an inquiry from Willia K. Garver, who was in charge of Library orders, Roppert indicated that he acquired the letter from Goodspeed&#039;s Book Shop in Boston. Phineas L. Windsor, Director of the Library, approved the purchase but sought to know &quot;who owned the coll.&quot; that contained the letter. On July 12, 1937, in the last item in the collection regarding the acquisition of Roppert&#039;s letter, Banks asked to see the &quot;Lincoln&quot; letter, as Goodspeed&#039;s was not &quot;likely to have sold it to Mr Felix Roppert with whom we have had considerable correspondence.&quot;<emph render="super">2</emph></p>
                                 <p>Two other &quot;Lincoln&quot; manuscripts concern a suit brought by William Miller against C. J. Edwards in the Circuit Court of Champaign County. In this suit, Miller, represented by Lincoln and Herndon, sued to recover $400 paid to Edwards for a certain parcel in which Edwards had no clear title. A memorandum in the collection states that the &quot;Two documents [were] identified as Cosey forgeries by G. William Bergquist, of the New York Public Library, Oct. 19 1949.&quot;</p>
                                 <p>Bergquist was an expert on literary hoaxes such as those perpetrated by Martin Coneely (1887-1950) whose favorite alias was Joseph Cosey.<emph render="super">3</emph> Cosey became Joseph Roppert in peddling the 1852 letter, the handwriting of which matches that of the 1858 legal papers. <emph render="italic">Lincoln Day by Day</emph>, now entitled &quot;The Lincoln Log&quot; on the website of The Papers of Abraham Lincoln, places Lincoln elsewhere on the relevant dates--in Sullivan, not Springfield, and in Springfield, not Urbana.</p>
