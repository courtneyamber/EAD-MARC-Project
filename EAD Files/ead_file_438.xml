               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                                 <p>James Sterling Ayars was a successful writer for young people, an editor of scientific and religious publications, and an activist for civil liberties and human rights. Ayars also served as a technical editor at the Illinois Natural History Survey from 1937 until his retirement in 1965. In addition, Ayars authored and co-authored eleven books which include: <emph render="italic">Basketball Comes to Lonesome Point </emph>(1952), <emph render="italic">Caboose on the Loose </emph>(1956), <emph render="italic">John James Audubon</emph> (1966), and <emph render="italic">We Hold These Truths</emph> (1977). His book, <emph render="italic">The Illinois River</emph> (1968), received the Clara Ingram Judson Award from the Society of Midland Authors in 1969. Ayars was married to Rebecca Caudill, a noted author of children&#039;s books. He and his wife were members of the Religious Society of Friends and the Champaign-Urbana Peace Council. Ayars was also active in the American Civil Liberties Union and in the Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Vietnam.</p>
                                 <p>Series I of the Ayars collection relates to the writing and publishing of <emph render="italic">The Illinois River</emph>, including correspondence, notes, early drafts, and card files. The card files include an index based on alphabetical headings, a card file based on subject note cards, and a card file based on brief descriptions of sources. The collection also contains pictures and photographs of Illinois River scenes, including snapshots taken by Ayars during research boat trips.</p>
                                 <p>Series II represents a substantial supplement to Series I. Reflecting Ayars&#039;s multifaceted career, it includes notes, drafts, and typescripts of unpublished and published stories, articles, and poems. It contains copies of his published writings and periodicals; notes, audio tapes, and transcripts of speeches and radio talks; and correspondence pertaining to his literary career. Ayars&#039;s role in the community can be seen in papers and correspondence relating to Trinity Methodist Church (and its long-time pastor, Paul Burt), the Religious Society of Friends, C-U Consumers Cooperative, the C-U Peace Council, ACLU, and the Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Vietnam.</p>
                                 <p>The collection also contains photocopies and typed transcriptions of twenty-two letters written by William H. Ayars during 1863-64. (The originals were returned to Becky Jeans Ayars Baker in 1988.) Will Ayars was a corporal in Co. B, 127th N.Y. Vol. Inf. from 1862 until 1864, when he became a lieutenant in the 31st U. S. Colored Infantry. He was killed at the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864.</p>
                                 <p>James Ayars donated Series I to the Library in 1970, and Series II in 1985-1986. His daughter, Becky Ayars Baker, donated additional material in 1988 that was incorporated into Series II.</p>
