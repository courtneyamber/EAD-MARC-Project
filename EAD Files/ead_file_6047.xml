                                 <p>This collection contains papers and correspondence of Ruth Painter Randall, a Lincoln scholar and author and wife of the Civil War and Lincoln historian Dr. James G. Randall.</p>
                                 <p>Ruth Painter Randall was born in Salem, Virginia on November 1, 1892. She graduated from Roanoke College with a Bachelor&#039;s of Arts degree in 1913, and then attended the University of Indiana to complete a Master&#039;s Degree in English in 1914. On August 21, 1917, she married James G. Randall, who became a professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1920. Ruth assisted her husband with his studies of Abraham Lincoln, helping him with research for his book <emph render="italic">Lincoln the President: From Springfield to Gettysburg</emph> (1945) and contributing two chapters to that work. Soon after, she began to produce her own works, publishing her first book, <emph render="italic">Mary Lincoln: Biography of a Marriage,</emph> shortly before her husband&#039;s death in 1953.</p>
                                 <p>In the years that followed, she continued to produce works of scholarship on the Lincoln family, including <emph render="italic">Lincoln&#039;s Sons</emph> (1955) and <emph render="italic">The Courtship of Mr. Lincoln</emph> (1957). She also wrote other biographies concerning figures of the era, including <emph render="italic">Colonel Elmer Ellsworth </emph>(1960), and books geared toward younger readers, including <emph render="italic">I, Mary</emph> (1959), <emph render="italic">I, Varina</emph> (1962), and <emph render="italic">I, Jessie</emph> (1963) - biographies of the wives of Abraham Lincoln, General George Custer, and General John C. Fremont. Ruth Painter Randall died in Urbana, Illinois on January 22nd, 1971.</p>
                                 <p>The collection includes a typed autobiographical account of Ruth Painter Randall&#039;s work, a statement concerning her biography of Colonel Elmer Ellsworth, and a list of books and periodicals from her husband&#039;s collection which she donated to the University of Illinois Library in 1965. It also includes personal correspondence concerning several books sent to Randall in the 1960s.</p>
                                 <p>Ruth Painter Randall&#039;s papers were donated to the Library sometime following her death in 1971.</p>
