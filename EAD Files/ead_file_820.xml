                                 <p>This collection contains scrapbooks, correspondence, bound volumes, and other materials from the personal collection of Kathryn G. Hansen, an author and employee of the University of Illinois. Hansen was heavily involved in professional organizations that focused on civil service and office support in universities.</p>
                                 <p>Kathryn G. Hansen was born in Gardner, Illinois, on May 24, 1912. After graduating from the University of Illinois with an M.S. in Education in 1936, she worked at the University of North Carolina before returning to Urbana-Champaign in 1937.</p>
                                 <p>Hansen held several positions at the University of Illinois from 1937 to 1952. She was first employed at the University High School from 1937 to 1944, and then became a staff member in the newly created Office of Nonacademic Personnel from 1944 to 1952. Between 1947 and 1952, she was also an Instructor in Psychology.</p>
                                 <p>From 1952 to 1972, she served in several offices of the University Civil Service System of Illinois. She was the first Executive Secretary and later the Administrative Officer. Appointed Director of the System in 1968, she retired from the University in 1972.</p>
                                 <p>Throughout her career, Hansen was active in numerous professional and community organizations. In 1970, she was awarded the first Donald E. Dickason Award for outstanding service to the College and University Personnel Association (CUPA). She was a founding member of the State Universities Civil Service System and The Secretariat, organizations for civil service and office support employees.</p>
                                 <p>Kathryn Hansen died July 26, 2006, at the age of 94.</p>
                                 <p>The collection is largely comprised of scrapbooks that document Hansen&#039;s personal and professional life, as well as some material on her family&#039;s history dating back to 1800. The scrapbooks particularly highlight her work at the University of Illinois and involvement with professional and civic organizations. In addition, the collection contains scrapbooks, correspondence, and other materials related to her novel, <emph render="italic">Grundy Corners</emph> (1982). Also included are bound volumes of several journals and newsletters, including <emph render="italic">The Illini Worker</emph>, <emph render="italic">Campus Pathways</emph>, <emph render="italic">CUPA Journal</emph>, and <emph render="italic">CUPA Newsletter</emph>; some topical files; and several awards and mementos Hansen received.</p>
                                 <p>Kathryn Hansen donated the collection to the Library in several parts from 2003 to 2005.</p>
