               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                                 <p>This collection is comprised of records from the Champaign-Urbana Area Home Economists (CUAHE) organization. The CUAHE sought to &quot;provide a way for homemakers to keep up with new developments, to provide professional and social contacts for home economist homemakers, and to provide exchanges of ideas in different age groups and between other states and colleges&quot; according to their purpose statement. Records include newsletters, minutes, reports, newspaper articles, program brochures, correspondence, and other materials.</p>
                                 <p>The CUAHE formed when a group of home economics alumnae met on September 29, 1958, in Bevier Hall on the University of Illinois&#039;s campus. The members originally named the organization the Home Economists in Homemaking (HEIH), but at a later date changed the name to the Champaign-Urbana Area Home Economists. The CUAHE was the fourth home economics group in Illinois at the time of its establishment, and it was affiliated with both the Illinois and the national American Home Economists Associations. The CUAHE&#039;s main function was to hold workshops and programs on the latest developments in the home economics field. The CUAHE was disbanded sometime after 2003, although the date is unknown.</p>
                                 <p>This collection is comprised of five series: Administrative, Programs, Publications, Artifacts, and Scrapbooks.</p>
                                 <p>Although the collection includes records dating from 1945 to 2003, the bulk of the material dates from the 1970s and the 1980s. The collection offers insight into the administrative functions of the organization, with records including bylaws, executive officer reports, minutes, correspondence, budgets, and other materials. The Programs series offers a look into the various workshops, meetings, and speakers the CUAHE scheduled for both its members and the community. These programs provided up-to-date information on nutrition, toys, sewing, household appliances, and other topics. Program records include flyers, brochures, correspondence, speaker introductions, and newspaper articles.</p>
                                 <p>The Publications series contains records such as newspaper articles, newsletters, and yearbooks. CUAHE newsletters discuss upcoming programs and projects; member news such as weddings, travel plans, and memorial services; and meeting minutes. Newspaper articles announce upcoming meetings and programs and also report on the various activities of CUAHE around the community. Also included in the Publications series are yearbooks, which include executive officer lists, member lists, upcoming programs, and bylaws.</p>
                                 <p>The Artifacts series contains a banner, keys, and two Betty Lamp charms. The Betty Lamp was the symbol of both the CUAHE as well as the national American Home Economists Association. Also included in the collection are two scrapbooks, which contain newspaper clippings, photographs, correspondence, and other materials.</p>
                                 <p>The Library acquired this collection from Jane Brichford, a former member and officer of CUAHE, in 2009.</p>
